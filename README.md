## 📌 What is this?

This is a fun little project that lets you chat with a random stranger in real time.  
When you join, you’ll be placed in a **queue**. As soon as another person joins, you’re both connected and can send messages instantly.

It’s **not truly anonymous** — this is just a small hobby project. All messages are stored in Firebase and can be seen by the project owner. **Don’t share anything sensitive**.

## 💬 How does it work?

1. **Join Queue** – You click "Find a Stranger" and the system puts you in a waiting room.
2. **Matchmaking** – When another player is also waiting, Firebase pairs you together in a temporary chat room.
3. **Chat** – Messages are sent in real time, powered by Firebase Realtime Database.
4. **Disconnect** – When one person leaves, the chat ends. The system cleans up the old room and returns you to the main page.

## ⚠️ Important Privacy Note

This is **only for fun**. It is **not secure** and **not private**.  
Messages, IP addresses, and other info **could be logged** for debugging or abuse prevention.
